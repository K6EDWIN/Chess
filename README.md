A high-performance, bitboard-based chess engine written in Python, complete with a playable GUI built using Pygame. This project was developed as a deep dive into the worlds of chess programming and artificial intelligence.

It supports all standard chess rules and is designed for experimentation, learning, and as a foundation for more complex chess AI projects.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Efficient Bitboard Representation**: Utilizes bitboards for fast and efficient move generation and board evaluation.
* **Complete Rule Set**: Full implementation of all chess rules, including:
    * Pawn promotions
    * En passant captures
    * Castling (king-side and queen-side)
    * Stalemate and checkmate detection
* **Playable GUI**: A clean and simple graphical interface powered by Pygame, allowing you to play against the AI or another human.
* **AI Opponent**: A built-in AI that uses a classic search algorithm to find the best move.
* **Move Validation**: Highlights legal moves for a selected piece, making it user-friendly.

## üß† The AI Engine

The brain of this engine is a **Minimax search algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. This allows the AI to search several moves deep into the game tree, pruning branches that are guaranteed to be worse than a move already found. This significantly speeds up the decision-making process without sacrificing the quality of the move.

The board's position is evaluated using a heuristic function that considers:

* **Material Advantage**: The total value of pieces for each side.
* **Piece-Square Tables**: The strategic value of a piece's position on the board (e.g., a knight in the center is more valuable than one in a corner).
* **King Safety**: Basic checks to evaluate the safety of the king.

This is a great foundation for anyone interested in game theory and AI search algorithms.
